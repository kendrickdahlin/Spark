# Firefly Algorithm

This directory contains many differenent implementations of the FireFly algorithm using Apache Spark.

## Contents
1. **FireFlySpark**
    - This folder contains programs that run the firefly algorithm in parallel using Apache Spark. 

2. **Testing**
    - This folder contains material to test the basic firefly program and find best parameters. 

3. **4Cluster2D.csv**
    - A basic dataset to run `firefly.py` on. Has two dimensions, four classes, and 5000 rows. 
4. **firefly.py**
    - Simple implementation of the FireFly algorithm without parallelizing using Apache Spark.
